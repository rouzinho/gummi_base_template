# gummi_base_template

This replaces the old gummi_description package, now separated into gummi_base_XXX and gummi_ee_XXX for easier change of end effectors.

## Setting-up

First set up a workspace

    $ mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
    $ cd catkin_ws/src

Fork or clone this repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/GummiArmCE/gummi_base_template.git` 

Download a suitable ee package, e. g., handshake:

`$ git clone https://github.com/GummiArmCE/gummi_ee_handshake.git`

To actually move the robot you will need either ros-\<YOUR-ROS-DISTRO\>-dynamixel-motor package installed or to you can clone the git from https://github.com/arebgun/dynamixel_motor.git . You will also need the gummi_interface package and if you want to use move-it, the gummi_moveit package: 

    $ git clone https://github.com/arebgun/dynamixel_motor.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/GummiArmCE/gummi_interface.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/GummiArmCE/gummi_moveit.git

Install all dependencies with rosdep:

`$ rosdep install -y --from-paths . --ignore-src --rosdistro <YOUR-ROS-DISTRO>`

Run catkin_make:

`$ catkin_make`

And source your workspace:

`$ source devel/setup.bash`

If you are working with multiple bases and you don't want to create new packages for each, you may also want to add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file:

    parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
    }
    export PS1="${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "

This is a nice tweak of your shell to show the current branch in which you are working.

## Setting up a new base

Rename the directory "gummi_base_template" to "gummi_base_YOUR_OWN_BASE"

`$ mv gummi_base_template gummi_base_YOUR_OWN_BASE`

Edit the file "gummi_base_YOUR_OWN_BASE/set_env_gummi.sh"

`$ gedit gummi_base_YOUR_OWN_BASE/set_env_gummi.sh`

And change the line containing "export ROS_GUMMI_BASE=template" to "export ROS_GUMMI_BASE=YOUR_OWN_BASE" (required for launch files and by yaml_gen)

Edit the file package.xml

`$ gedit package.xml`

And change `<name>gummi_base_template</name>` to  `<name>gummi_base_YOUR_OWN_BASE</name>` (required finding the meshes - and textures if any- in the urdf file). 

You can now proceed to change "gummi_base_YOUR_OWN_BASE/launch/controllers_base.launch" to contain the motor drivers that your base has and where they are connected in the bus and the updating the yaml definitions of joints in "gummi_base_YOUR_OWN_BASE/dynamixel"

## Changing Urdf definitions:

Currently the urdf file is being generated during the catkin_make routine from the files in the xacro directory "gummi_description.urdf.xacro", "gummi_description_base.urdf.xacro" and an external file from the end effector "gummi_description_ee.urdf.xacro".

The simple setup we planned it to have all joint and link definitions for the base in the "gummi_description_base.urdf.xacro" (as well as "gummi_description_ee.urdf.xacro" containing the joints and links for the end effector only) and the file "gummi_description.urdf.xacro" would just call both and include them.

To change this to a new setup, simple either write by hand, or generate it from a solidworks model the URDF file as usual and place the joints and links from gripper up to the elbow joint (inclusive) in the end-effector xacro file and the remainder joints and links, that is, from base to elbow (exclusive) in the base urdf xacro file

TO DO:
 - finish separating yaml files
 - integrate alterations into gummi_interface

## New in this version (v1.0.0):

- First stable and tested version with the dovetail design. Tested with planning via moveit integration. 
- Decided to use branches instead of new repositories to keep all the different base definitions.
